# READ ME_Module 2 Challenge

Hello, and thank you for your time. 

## Instructions

Be sure to run the Subs in the following order:

1st: ticker_symbol
2nd: yearly_change
3rd: stock_volume
4th: functionality_gpi
5th: functionality_gpd
6th: functionality_gtv

Also, any feedback on how to get all of my code to run smoothly under one Sub, would be much appreciated.
